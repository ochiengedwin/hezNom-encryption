# hezNom-encryption
A python program for text encryption.

This is a simple encryption code written in python.

To use it, clone or copy the code as a whole to your machine and power it up on your terminal as below:

   for windows systems:
   
       \Desktop> py <file-name.py>
       \Desktop> py HezNomCipher.py
       
   for linux systems
   
       ~: python3 <file-name.py>
       ~: python3 HezNomCipher.py
       
Choose what to do with the program as it dispalys on the ui screen.

For encryption, type in your plain text and provide a valid integer password of length six to encrypt your message. A cipher text will be dispalyed on your screen.

Take note of the password as this program doesn't store passwords or texts.

For decryption, type in the HezNom encrypted text and provide the valid corresponding password to decrypt. A plain text will be printed on the screen.


This is how the program looks like on windows:
